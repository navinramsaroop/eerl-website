      "The Detroit News: Move to freeze Obama-era mpg rules likely to set off fight",
    author: "Keith Laing",
    date: "August 2, 2018",
    excerpt:
      "But Max Zhang, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., said the Trump administration’s move to roll back mileage rules could have an unintended consequence of giving foreign-owned automakers an advantage over Detroit’s manufacturers. He noted that European, Japanese and Chinese automakers are “all aggressively pursuing research and development in zero-tailpipe emission vehicles. “Thirty-seven miles per gallon, the new fuel-efficiency target by 2026 as the current proposal indicates, can be achieved by strategies such as improving internal combustion engines and modest weight reduction,” Zhang said. “By contrast, 54 miles per gallon, as the Obama administration proposed, will certainly require auto manufacturers to massively introduce zero-tailpipe emission vehicles such as electric and fuel-cell vehicles to the fleets.”",

    excerpt:
      "Max Zhang, an engineering professor at Cornell University, has studied air pollution from diesel generators. In general, he said, diesel generators have an outsized impact on pollution compared to other sources of power: “Basically, they tend to be dirtier per unit of energy provided.”",

    excerpt:
      "Max Zhang, an associate professor at Cornell University in New York who specializes in the effects of airborne particulate matters on air quality, said the conditions in Beijing were a result of the “perfect storm” of several factors. Although air pollution is a constant problem in China, Zhang said the end of the cold weather season, when the government provides coal-based heat to areas of the country from November to about March 15, had fueled more dangerous conditions.",

    excerpt:
      "At the county’s Planning, Development and Environmental Quality Committee this afternoon, legislators are set to vote to authorize a Request for Proposals for a medium-scale wind turbine scale. “When we developed the energy road map, we found there are a lot of places in the county that have the wind resources to drive a small-to-medium size turbine. It could be a great source of renewable energy for a farm operation or a business in a rural area,” said Tompkins County deputy planning commissioner Katie Borgella.",

Outlining several scenarios of the impacts of various changes in our energy consumption on the environment, the Energy Roadmap offers a snapshot of local energy consumption and where we could reduce – or replace – our energy consumption with renewable sources.",
